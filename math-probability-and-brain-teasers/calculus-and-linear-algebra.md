# Linear Algebra

### Concepts

* Vectors and Matrix
  * vectors
  * matrix operations
    * invertible and singular matrix
    * relationship between linear system and matrix
    * permutation matrix
    * Gaussian elimination
    * matrix factorization
* Vector Space
  * row space, column space
  * null space
  * rank
  * span
    * rank, span and solution of linear system

# Calculus

1. $$(lnx^{lnx})'$$
   1. use the log trick and chain rule
2. Integrate
   1. ln\(x\)
   2. sec\(x\) 
      1. method1 : multiplies $$\frac{secx+tanx}{secx+tanx}$$
      2. method2: sec\(x\) = 1/cosx = cosx/cos^2 x = cosx / \(1- sin^2x \)
   3. E\(X\|X&gt;0\) for normal random variable
   4. **total area under curve for normal p.d.f**
      1. Calculate $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2/2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-y^2/2}$$ and use polar \(rcos, rsin\) axis \(Fubini's Rule\)
3. Calculate volume/distance/mass/probability using integration
   1. snow begins 12pm, snow plow can clear constant volume per minute, 1pm moved 2miles, 2pm, 3 miles, when did the snow fall?
4. Proof
   1. Mean-Value Theorem
   2. Newton's Method
5. Concepts
   1. Remann vs Lebesgue
6. Tricks
   1. x^x^... = 2, x = ? if = 4, x = ?
