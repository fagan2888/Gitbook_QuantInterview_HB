# Data Science/Machine Learning Project

For take-home exercise, often use Jupyter Notebook or R-Markdown. From very open-ended to very detailed instructions\(accuracy score expected\)

1. Problem
   1. understand the problem
      1. key challenge and necessary domain knowledges
2. Data
   1. Exploratory Data Analysis - understand the data
      1. occasionally: deal with big data
         1. either drop part of the data or use more advanced \(parallel\) platforms
      2. summarize descriptive analysis
   2. Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning
      1. Missing Value handling and impact analysis
3. Feature Matrix
   1. Understanding features
      1. deal with categorical features \(encoding\)
   2. Feature Engineering
      1. eg. tokenizing, stemming, word2vec ,TF-IDF
   3. Feature Selection
4. Models
   1. Pre-proessing before model training
   2. Optimize metrics
      1. hyper parameters tuning
   3. model evaluation and model selection
      1. Classification vs Regression 
      2. model specific features
         1. eg. feature importance from tree-based models
         2. L1, L2 regularization
5. Evaluation
   1. Model Evaluation and Selection\(Offline\)
   2. A/B Testing\(Online\)
6. Business Value/Summary
   1. Business Case Analysis
   2. The most important part
