### Data Science/Machine Learning Project

1. Data
   1. Exploratory Data Analysis
   2. Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning
      1. Missing Value handling and impact analysis
2. Feature Matrix
   1. Feature Engineering
   2. Feature Selection
3. Models
4. Evaluation
   1. Model Evaluation and Selection\(Offline\)
   2. A/B Testing\(Online\)
5. Business Value
   1. Business Case Analysis

#### Take-home/Onsite Data Challenge

Often use Jupyter Notebook or R-Markdown. From very open-ended to very detailed instructions\(accuracy score expected\)

* Data exploration
  * occasional: deal with big data - either drop part of data or use more advanced platforms
  * descriptive statistics
  * feature matrix
* Data-preprossing
  * dealing with missing values, outliers
* Modeling
  * not always necessary
* Summary Report/Presentation
  * most important part

### Machine Learning Overview

* Set-up
  * Batch Learning vs Online Learning
  * Instance Based Learning vs Model Based Learning
  * Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, reinforcement learning
