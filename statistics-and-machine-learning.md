# Data Science/Machine Learning Project

For take-home exercise, often use Jupyter Notebook or R-Markdown. From very open-ended to very detailed instructions\(accuracy score expected\)

1. Data
   1. Exploratory Data Analysis
      1. occasionally: deal with big data
         1. either drop part of the data or use more advanced \(parallel\) platforms
      2. summarize descriptive analysis
   2. Data Wrangling, Data Cleaning
      1. Missing Value handling and impact analysis
2. Feature Matrix
   1. Feature Engineering
   2. Feature Selection
3. Models
4. Evaluation
   1. Model Evaluation and Selection\(Offline\)
   2. A/B Testing\(Online\)
5. Business Value/Summary
   1. Business Case Analysis
   2. The most important part
