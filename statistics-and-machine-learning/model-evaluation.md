## Cross-Validation

* hold-one out vs k-fold
  * information leaking when use to validate parameters
* Use Bootstrapping
  * 1/e rule
* Time-Series Data
  * not use future information
  * ARIMA 
* how to decompose bias and variance
  * in-sample vs out-of sample error

## Confusion Matrix

* When Accuracy can be irrelavant
  * unbalanced sample
* High Precision/High Recall situation
  * system error/security - recall first
  * spam mail - precision first
  * investment signal
* F1 score, F beta score
* ROC Curve, PR Curve
  * TPR, FPR
  * ROC's relationship with rank correctness
  * **ROC vs PR Curve\***

## Loss Functions and Measures

* RMSE weakness
  * noise/outlier

## A/B Testing

## Overfitting and Underfitting

* Explain/derive Bias-Variance Tradeoff
* How to decompose error to bias/variance
  * in-sample and out-of-sample error
* lower bias/underfitting
  * more data/data augmentation
  * model complexity 
    * AIC, BIC
  * regularization
  * ensemble learning
* lower vairance/overfitting
  * new feature/feature engineeting
  * model complexity
  * lower regularization
