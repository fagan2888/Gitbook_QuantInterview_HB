### Statistical Inference

* Law of Large Number
* Central Limit Theorem
  * i.i.d assumption
* Estimation
  * Method of Moments
  * MLE
    * calculation: 
      *  exponential dist MLE
      *  binomial MLE \(variance, used in Monte Carlo\)
    * What is Fisher Information
      * cutting variance to half, double the sample size
  * Consistency
  * Confidence Interval
    * the interval is random, the parameter is fixed
* Hypothesis Test
  * Type I error, significance \(precision\)
  * Type II error, power \(recall\)
  * how to test multiple hypothesis\(FWER vs FDR\)
* Error
* Bias-Variance Decomposition
* Computational Approach
  * Permutation Test
  * BootStrapping
    * what is the percentage left out of sample? \(N -&gt; inf for sampling times and sample size\)

### Random Numbers

* Use Random\(5\) to generate Random\(25\) / Random\(21\) \(use 5 \* random\(5\) + random\(5\)\)
  * two-dimensional matrix + sample with replacement
